In your own words, define what a game is. 
A system where players interact in a conflict, has rules, and has an outcome.

What is Game Design? 
The creative process of making rules, systems, goals, and challenges that make a game.

What is the MDA framework? What are its parts? Define each.
Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics. Aesthetics is how the player feels about the game and their emotions toward it. Dynamics is the gameplay that comes from the player playing the game. Mechanics are the rules, systems, and actions in the game.

Use the MDA framework to analyze your modified game. Write down your game then fill out these sections:

Mechanics - What rule/mechanic did your modify in your game? 
Instead of going to 21, we went to 25 in Blackjack. The face cards were any number we wanted to choose.

Dynamics - How does the gameplay of your modded game differ from that original version?
If you get all face cards, it's easier to get to 21.

How much does your modification change how the game feels to plays? What emotions change in players between both versions?
It seems unfair when you don't get face cards and your opponent does.
